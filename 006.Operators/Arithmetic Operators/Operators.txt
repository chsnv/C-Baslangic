Operator  Description                                                       Example 
+         Adds two operands.                                                A + B = 30 
-         Subtracts second operand from the first.                          A - B = -10 
*         Multiplies both operands.                                         A * B = 200 
/         Divides numerator by de-numerator.                                B / A = 2 
%         Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division.      B % A = 0 
++        Increment operator increases the integer  value by one.           A++ = 11 
--        Decrement operator decreases the integer value by one.            A-- = 9
